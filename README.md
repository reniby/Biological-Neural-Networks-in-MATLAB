# Biological-Neural-Networks-in-MATLAB
Use mathematical neuron models to build logical gates in MATLAB

Use HH to run, user inputs are marked on the top
Can run the program as a NOT, AND, and OR gate, or as an XOR gate (as a combination of the first three)
Can input custom inputs (2 inputs for AND, OR, XOR, 1 input for NOT)
